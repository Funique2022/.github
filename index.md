## What is FMF ?

A list of tools that helps you quick build a funique project.

The article will guide you install the plugin to inherit the base and extend the manager features.

## Why use FMF ?

When i first time see the code structure and the way we maintain the codes, i be honest, it is pretty messy, colleague usually copy code file and ignore the dependencies issue or version issue, and often time, the code itself does not provide unit test, so often time, it stuck at environemnt testing stage.

To solve this problem, it's pretty commom to thinks that we should sort out the code, and improve the maintainability. FMF will seperate all the codes in to plugins, and each plugins has its own unit testing, the result and view on each repo pages, the support version etc...

The dependencies will solve by this way, each plugins has very clear dependencies requirement, so we won't confuse when we trying to pull the login in the projects.

Another benifit is that, it's better have a docsmentation here to do things. so people won't ever get lost when login needs to be change.
