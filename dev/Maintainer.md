# Maintainer

All the unity modules and integration package are using NPM to host it, We use unity package manager to get funique package.

The code under Github organization repository is for alpha, beta development. After we finihs debugging and testing, Maintainer should push the latest version to NPM.

The issue is, Unity package manager does not support NPM organization scope for search package, So if we want to add a new maintainer, we have to manually add to package one by one.
